## Raw Data preprocessing and Features selection
In order to have balanced and meaningful feature of each stocks, we calculate some meaningful features from raw data. With raw data at hand, we recommend calculating meaningful features so that the training result is reasonable.

### Feature list
We Calculate Beta for each Sector. 
E(R<sub>i</sub>) = &beta;<sub>1</sub>E(R<sub>Tech</sub>) + &beta;<sub>2</sub>E(R<sub>Utility</sub>) + ... + &beta;<sub>1</sub>E(R<sub>Financial</sub>) + &epsilon;
